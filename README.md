# cia2elf
Converts a cia to elf. Python3. Public domain.

## Dependancies
cia2elf needs requests and pyctr to be installed. 

You also need to have `boot9.bin` present in `%APPDATA%/3ds` on windows, `~/.3ds/` on linux or `~/Library/Application Support/3ds` on macos if you want to convert encrypted cias.

## Usage
cia2elf.py filename
